        <h1>Week 8 - Notes</h1>

        <h2>Develop, Debug, Learn? Video</h2>
        <p>The takeaway from this video is that it is a promotion for VSCode because it's so versatile in the sense
            that is lets us create a variety of file types while also guessing (pulling from popular code to date) what
            we would type in next. Although that is helpful, it may lead us to forget what we're actually building. Will we 
            stop learning how something works because AI is able to guess what we're going to put? That may be possible but a 
            computer can't usually debug itself. It's like trying to troubleshoot the WIFI when it's not connected. You have to
            manually connect it by putting in the password. I enjoyed this video also because it's telling us to learn what we're 
            putting together. A lot of older coding programs aren't in use anymore because programmers wanted to use less code. I 
            believe the speaker mentioned that a lot of work was done on Java before HTML was even invented which is crazy to 
            believe because HTML is what I have come to believe that the base of a project is then the JS code to add functionality 
            and then CSS to make it looks pleasing to the user. The premise of the video is that it's good to know all of these things
            but it's also good to keep learning new things. Coding is something that is forever evolving.

        <h2>JSON Web Tokens</h2>
        <p>While reading the article, I found that JWTs are important and are used a lot more than I think. It's when the client [the user]
            wants to access something on the website but the server, for example, wants them to log in in order to verify that they have access
            to a specific part of the website. Kind of like a free trial versus a paying user experience. So the user puts in their username and
            password, then that goes to the server, the server checks if the information received it valid and from there will decide if 
            they grant the client access. If not, an error will send. If they're granted access, they get permissions to access a different
            experience.</p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>I understand that this is a Front End Class, will we be implementing this now or as we're in careers like Back End or Database?</p>
