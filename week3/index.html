        <p>The Direct Object Model [DOM] is  represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.</p>
        <p>The DOM treats everything on a web page as a node. HTML tags, the text inside these tags, even the attributes of a tag are all nodes. 
            The HTML tag is the root node, and every other part of the document is a child node of this.</p>
        <p>*The DOM stores whitespace as text nodes.</p>
        <a href="heroes.html">Heroes Code</a>
        <p>All nodes have a numerical code to signify what type they are.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>1 - Element</p></li>
            <li><p>2 - Attribute</p></li>
            <li><p>3 - Text</p></li>
            <li><p>8 - Comment</p></li>
            <li><p>9 - Body</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Node lists are array-like object but they are NOT arrays. Items can be accessed using index notation [0,1,2,3,...]</p>
        <p>They also don't have array methods like slice, splice, and join.</p>
