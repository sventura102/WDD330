        <p><b>Variables</b> have to be declared before they can be used. From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords const and let to declare variables. The keyword const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</p>

        <p>Using <b>const</b> and <b>let</b> to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are declared in.</p>

        <p>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have <b>global scope.</b> This means it is accessible everywhere in the program.</p>

        <p><b>Local Scope</b>means that any variables defined inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that block</p>

        <p><b>Template Literals</b> are defined by backticks (`) and be used instead of strings while also inserting JS expressions.</p>

        <p><b>Arrays</b></p>

        <p>[constant].length defines the variable in a array. It starts at 0.</p>
        <p>.pop returns the last variable in a array, but the array now doesn't have the </p>
        <p>join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array</p>
        <p>slice() method creates a subarray; effectively chopping out a slice of an original array, starting at one position and finishing at another. </p>
