        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>Forms are made up of a <b>form</b> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.
        These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.</p>
        <p>When it comes to forms we want the user to be able to input information via accessible controls through the
            making of forms. A lot of it is done in the Front End.</p>
        <p><b>document.forms</b> will return an HTML collection of all the forms on the page.</p>
        <p><b>forms.elements</b> will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</p>
        <p>Forms have a <b>submit</b> event that can be used to intercept a form before it's been submitted.</p>
        
        <h2>Object Oriented Programming(OOP) in JS</h2>
        <p>Often used to model representations of objects in the real world.</p>
        <p>There are three main concepts in OOP: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.</p>
        <p><b>Encapsulation</b>- this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how itâ€™s done.</p>
        <p><b>Polymorphism</b>- (the same process can be used for different objects)  this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
        <p><b>Inheritance</b>- (taking the same features and putting it inside another object)  this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>
        <p>An alternative way to create objects is to use a <b>constructor function.</b></p>
        <p>The keywords <b>this</b>is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function.</p>
        <p>JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model. This means that every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class.</p>
