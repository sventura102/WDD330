        <h1>UX Design Principles</h1>
        <p>In order for an app to work, a lot of implementation needs to be user-friendly. Otherwise,
            users can become frustrated and choose to not use the app because it is hard to use.
        </p>
        <p><b>Important things to remember:</b></p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Touch Screen Target Size</b>- make sure buttons are big enough to press on</li>
            <li><b>User Control</b>- preferences, like screen displays, accommodate to the user's needs.</li>
            <li><b>Text Legibility</b>- allow for users to read what is on the screen, especially important information. Allow for implementation of size/font configurations. This also applies to the interface in order to be able to see it at night, during the day, outside, and inside.</li>
            <li><b>Hand Positions</b>- common features should be kept in easy to reach places (usually the center of the screen) and others (like the delete button) should be in the top corners, which require more reach.</li>
            <li><b>Seamless experience</b>- allow app to use feature the phone may already have. Better to have the user not have to think so much about the functionality but enjoy using the app.</li>
