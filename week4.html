        <p>The Direct Object Model [DOM] is  represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.</p>
        <p>The DOM treats everything on a web page as a node. HTML tags, the text inside these tags, even the attributes of a tag are all nodes. 
            The HTML tag is the root node, and every other part of the document is a child node of this.</p>
        <p>*The DOM stores whitespace as text nodes.</p>
