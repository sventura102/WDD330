        <h1>Week 7- Notes</h1>
        
        <p><b>Code blocks</b> keep JS code from interpreting the wrong line. Everything within the curly brackets get called without intervening
            with anything outside of it. In the same note, if something outside of the curly brackets was called even though the variable is only
            on the inside then it will just return an error message because that code doesn't exist outside of the curly brackets. Only within it.

            Ex: {
                let message = "Hello"; (only visible in this block)
                alert (message): (Hello)
            }

            alert (message); (message will return in error because it's calling a variable within the code block.)
        </p>
        <p><b>Nested Functions</b> refers to a function created within another function. It can access any variables outside of it.</p>

        <p>The <b>Lexical Environment </b> consists of two parts:
            <ul><i>Environmental Record</i> stores all local variables as its properties.</ul>
            <ul><i>Outer Lexical Environment </i> which is associated with any outside code.</ul>
        
            If the variable changes throughout the code, the Lexical Environment will pick up the most recent change to the variable.
        </p>

        <p><b>Currying</b> is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments. It allows us to call the arguments again, 
            allowing us to create other functions, without changing the original function. </p>
