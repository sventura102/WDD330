        <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
        <!--Notes on Debugging. Essential when looking for errors in HTML-->
        <h2><b>Debugging</b></h2>
        <p>Debugging is the process of a finding and fixing errors within a script.</p>
        <p>In order to get start, you need to get to the sources panel. On windows, press f12 and go to the sources panel. It will show all the different files that made up the code on the website.</p>
        <p>The <b>File Navigator</b> lists all of those things including HTML, JS, CSS, and more. Even Chrome extensions.</p>
        <p>The <b>Code Editor</b> shows the source code.</p>
        <p>The <b>Javascript Debugging</b> pane is for debugging.</p>

        <p>If we press <i>ESC</i> then the console opens below. Here we can type commands and press <i>ENTER</i> to execute.</p>

        <p> A <i>breakpoint</i> is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution. When paused, we can look at the variables and try to debug it if needed.</p>

        <p>It allows us to...
            <ul>Go to a breakpoint with the help of the right panel.</ul>
            <ul>Disable the breakpoint by unchecking it.</ul>
            <ul>Remove the breakpoint by right-clicking and selecting Remove.</ul>
        </p>

        <p>There are different buttons that allow for different executions.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>The <b>Resume</b> key, hotkey F8, allows for the execution to continue.</ul>
            <ul>The <b>Step</b> key, hotkey F9, runs the next statement. Clicking it again and again will step through all the script statements one by one.</ul>
            <ul>The <b>Step over</b>, hotkey F10, runs the next statement but doesn't go into the function.</ul>
            <ul>The <b>Enable/Disable</b> button does not move the execution it just works as an on/off for breakpoints.</ul>
            <ul>The hexagon with a pause sign inside of it will cause the execution to pause when there is an error.</ul>
        </p>

        <!--Notes on Coding Style-->

        <h2><b>Coding Style</b></h2>
        <p><b>Line Length</b> should be agreed upon at the team level. Usually 80 or 120 characters.</p>
        <p><b>Horizontal Indents</b> allows for there to be more organization so code is not so jumbled together. Easy to find things that are within other sections, classes, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Function Placement</b> is a rule that allows code, that the function is going to call, to be called first before creating the function.</p>
        <p><b>Semicolons</b> should be used after every statement.</p>

        <!--Catching Errors-->

        <h2><b>Questions</b></h2>
        <p>
            <ul>Will it be necessary to use the Try, Catch code or will we be using online verifiers?</ul>
        </p>
