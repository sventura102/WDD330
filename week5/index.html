        <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>
        <h2>Fetch</h2>
        <p>Fetch allows us to get data from another server by creating a function that will allow us to get the information from a URL.</p>
        <p>Oftentimes, it won't fully load so we need to set a return for it to tell us if there is an error if it won't show the information.</p>
        <p>The errors that we received for this week required us to use our console log in order to find error in our JS because it wasn't showing the information 
            we wanted or the error itself.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Single Apps</h2>
        <p>Single apps allows for the site to pull information from the site without reloading the browser.</p>
        <p>This allows for users to search the site and not have to refresh everything completely (which would probably need info to be sent into 
            the server and then back to the user to find what they're looking for. that would probably take to long, even creating an individual HTMLpage
            for what they are looking for.)
        </p>
        <p>Although it sounds very good and practical in theory, it takes a lot of time to develop as well as keeping the site from actually processing to a whole
            different page. Instead, it was said in the 'Problem with single page apps' that it's just better to make JS that changes the URL in order to load the correct page!
        </p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>Would we always want to use Fetch in order to grab information from another page?</p>
        <p>What would be a good example of a website that was only wanting to pull specific content from a page? Would we use JSON instead if it wasn't possible?</p>
