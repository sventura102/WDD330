        <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in the program. They usually caused by one of the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>System error</b>- there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Programmer error</b>- the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>User error</b>- the use has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>An <b>exception</b> is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
        <p>Exceptions can also produce a <b>stack trace</b>. This is a sequence of methods or functions that lead to the point where the error occured.</p>
        <p>A <b>warning</b> can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run <br>
        after a warning. This may cause the program to continuing running <i>incorrectly</i></p>

        <p><b>It is better to fail loudly than quietly so error can be identified and fixed quickly.</b></p>

        <p>Using strict mode allows for less mistakes by catching errors early on. <b>It must be declared prior to writing code.</b></p>

        <p><b>Linting Tools</b> can be used to test to quality of JS code, beyond only using strict mode. It's designed to highlight sloppy programming or syntax errors.</p>

        <p>By using the console in the browser, we're able to identify bugs in the code and debug it.</p>

        <p><b>Error Objects</b> notify the user of when an exception occurs. Created by 'const error = new Error();'</p>

        <h2>Tests</h2>

        <p>While often overlooked, it's important to test code so that errors can be indentified early.</p>

        <p>In order to catch them, Sitepoint says to follow these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Write tests</p></li>
            <li><p>Write code to pass the tests</p></li>
            <li><p>Refractor the code</p></li>
            <li><p>Test refractored code</p></li>
            <li><p>Write more tests for new features</p></li>
        </ul>
